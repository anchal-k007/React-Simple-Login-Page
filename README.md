# Simple React Login Page Project
This is a React app that has been created to mimic a simple Login page.
It has been created as a part of this Udemy course as a part of sections 10-11 
[https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/](Course Link)

This project uses some of these concepts 
  1. React components, states, conditional rendering
  2. React **useReducer** to create complex React state variables in the Input form
  3. React **useEffect** hook to handle side effects such as filling a form
  4. React **useContext** to create contexts and remove props chain. This is used to maintain the login information of a user across the app. The login functionality creates a simple localStorage variable without cryptography to check if a user is already logged in or not. Remember that this is not a secure method, but it is not the aim of this app to enforce proper cryptographic mechanisms to establish secure connections

The aim of this app is to practice and learn some of the concepts mentioned above in React.
